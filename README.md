# Go rest API practice
Create an rest API in Go using the Gin framework.  
And it follow by https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bj77B59nkTQ  

## Init the Go Gin framework

If you want to init the gin framework you need to type down  
=> go mod init (with file name)  
EX: go mod init example/GO_API  

--------------------------------

If you want to install some module you need to type down  
=> go get (with module)
EX: go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin  

--------------------------------

If you want to run the application you needto type down  
=> go run (with .go file)
EX: go run main.go

## Testing API
We use the VScode build in tool "Rest client" for testing  
You can use tripple hash tag for comment  
And you can easily write down the rest command such as GET, POST ...etc
